🌪 CYCLONES & ANTICYCLONES

(PGT Climatology – Concept Core Notes)

🟢 1️⃣ Cyclone – Definition

Cyclone =
Low pressure system jisme hawa converge karke upward rise karti hai.

Core Feature:

Northern Hemisphere → Anti-clockwise rotation

Southern Hemisphere → Clockwise rotation

(Coriolis effect)

🔥 2️⃣ Types of Cyclones
1️⃣ Tropical Cyclone

Warm core system

Energy from latent heat

5°–20° latitude

No fronts

Eye present

Weak vertical wind shear required

2️⃣ Temperate Cyclone (Extratropical)

Cold core system

Front based system

Polar front theory

Strong baroclinic instability

Larger size

🌀 3️⃣ Polar Front Theory (Bjerknes Model)

Stages:

Stationary Front

Wave Formation

Open Wave Cyclone

Mature Stage (Occlusion)

Dissipation

🌡 4️⃣ Warm Core vs Cold Core
Feature	Tropical	Temperate
Core	Warm	Cold
Energy	Latent heat	Temperature gradient
Fronts	Absent	Present
Size	Smaller	Larger
🌀 5️⃣ Eye & Eye Wall (Tropical)

Eye = Calm, descending air

Eye wall = Most intense convection

Strongest winds here

🧊 6️⃣ Anticyclone

High pressure system

Diverging winds

Descending air

Clear sky

Northern Hemisphere:

Clockwise rotation

⚠ PGT Traps

Tropical cyclone = Warm core

Temperate cyclone = Cold core

Tropical cyclone weakens over land

Anticyclone = Subsidence
