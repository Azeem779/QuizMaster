🌡 CLIMATE CHANGE & GLOBAL WARMING

(Modern Climatology – High Analytical Topic)

🟢 1️⃣ Climate Change – Definition

Climate Change =
Long-term alteration in temperature, precipitation, wind pattern and other climatic elements.

⚠ Weather ≠ Climate
Weather = Short term
Climate = Long term (≥30 years)

🔥 2️⃣ Types of Climate Change
1️⃣ Natural Causes

Milankovitch Cycles

Volcanic eruptions

Solar radiation variation

Plate tectonics

2️⃣ Anthropogenic Causes (Most Important)

Greenhouse gas emissions

Deforestation

Industrialization

Fossil fuel burning

🌍 3️⃣ Greenhouse Effect
Natural Greenhouse Effect:

Earth habitable banata hai

Enhanced Greenhouse Effect:

Excess GHG → More heat trapped

Main gases:

CO₂

CH₄

N₂O

CFCs

🔥 4️⃣ Radiative Forcing

Radiative Forcing =
Change in energy balance of Earth system

Positive forcing → Warming
Negative forcing → Cooling

CO₂ → Positive forcing

🧊 5️⃣ Feedback Mechanisms
Positive Feedback

Ice–Albedo feedback

Water vapor feedback

Negative Feedback

Cloud reflection

Carbon sink effect

🌊 6️⃣ Sea Level Rise Mechanism

Two main causes:

Thermal expansion

Glacial & ice sheet melting

⚠ Arctic amplification important

❄ 7️⃣ Arctic Amplification

Polar regions warm faster because:

Ice melt

Reduced albedo

More heat absorption

🌧 8️⃣ Climate Change & Monsoon

Monsoon variability increase

Extreme rainfall events

Longer dry spells

📊 9️⃣ IPCC Role

IPCC = Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

Functions:

Scientific assessment

Emission scenarios

Climate models

🔥 10️⃣ Carbon Cycle

Sources:

Respiration

Combustion

Sinks:

Oceans

Forests

Imbalance → Global warming

🧠 11️⃣ Climate Models

GCM (General Circulation Models)

Scenario-based projections

RCP pathways

⚠ PGT Exam Traps

Ozone hole ≠ Global warming

Weather event ≠ Climate change proof

CO₂ only gas nahi hai

Volcanic eruption long-term warming cause nahi

📌 Concept Chain
