🟢 1️⃣ Thermal vs Dynamic Pressure
🔥 Thermal Pressure (Temperature based)

Garam hawa → expand → density kam → upar uthti → Low Pressure

Thandi hawa → dense → niche baithti → High Pressure

📌 Example:

Equatorial Low (ITCZ) → thermal low

Polar High → thermal high

🔵 Dynamic Pressure (Circulation based)

Direct temperature se nahi

Vertical air movement + global circulation se

📌 Example:

Subtropical High (30°) → descending air from Hadley cell

Subpolar Low (60°) → convergence zone

⚠ Exam trap:
Har low thermal nahi hota.
Har high cold se nahi banta.

🟡 2️⃣ Global Pressure Belts (7 Belts Model)
Latitude	Type	Nature
0°	Equatorial Low	Thermal
30° N/S	Subtropical High	Dynamic
60° N/S	Subpolar Low	Dynamic
90° N/S	Polar High	Thermal

👉 Total 7 belts (1 equatorial + 2 subtropical + 2 subpolar + 2 polar)

🌀 3️⃣ Three Cell Model (Planetary Circulation)
1️⃣ Hadley Cell (0°–30°)

Warm air rises at ITCZ

Moves poleward aloft

Descends at 30°

Forms Subtropical High

👉 Responsible for Trade Winds

2️⃣ Ferrel Cell (30°–60°)

Indirect cell

Driven by Hadley & Polar cell interaction

Westerlies originate here

3️⃣ Polar Cell (60°–90°)

Cold dense air sinks at poles

Moves toward 60°

Meets warm air → Polar Front

🌪 4️⃣ Coriolis Force (PGT Level Logic)

Due to Earth’s rotation

Deflects:

Right in Northern Hemisphere

Left in Southern Hemisphere

📌 Important:

Zero at Equator

Maximum at Poles

Affects direction, not speed

⚠ Mathematical angle:
Coriolis ∝ sin(latitude)

🌬 5️⃣ Ferrel’s Law

Statement:
Wind is deflected:

Right in Northern Hemisphere

Left in Southern Hemisphere

Exam trick:

Law = direction logic

Cause = Coriolis force

🌍 6️⃣ ITCZ (Inter Tropical Convergence Zone)

Low pressure belt near equator

Trade winds converge

Strong convection

Heavy rainfall

Seasonal Shift:

Moves north in July

Moves south in January

🐎 7️⃣ Horse Latitudes (30°)

Subtropical High region

Descending dry air

Major deserts located here

WHY?
Because descending air suppresses cloud formation.

🌧 8️⃣ Subpolar Low (60°)

Warm westerlies meet cold polar easterlies

Polar front formation

Temperate cyclones originate here

🧠 High-Level Concept Chain

Insolation → Temperature → Pressure → Wind → Circulation → Climate

⚠ PGT Exam Traps

Ferrel Cell is thermally indirect.

Subtropical high is dynamic, not thermal.

ITCZ is not fixed at equator.

Coriolis does not act at equator.

Polar high is thermal high.

🎯 Conceptual Understanding Question

Why are deserts located around 30° latitude?

Answer:
Descending limb of Hadley cell → Adiabatic warming → Dry stable air → No rainfall.
